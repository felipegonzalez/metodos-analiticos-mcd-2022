# Análisis de conjuntos frecuentes {#frecuentes}



Una de las tareas más antiguas de la minería de datos
es la búsqueda de **conjuntos frecuentes en canastas**, o un 
análisis derivado que se llama **análisis de reglas de asociación**.

Originalmente, pensamos que tenemos una colección grande de tickets
de un supermercado. Nos interesa encontrar subconjuntos
de artículos (por ejemplo, pan y leche) que ocurren 
frecuentemente en esos tickets. La idea es que si tenemos estos
subconjuntos frecuentes, entonces podemos entender mejor el tipo de compras
que hacen los clientes, diseñar mejor promociones y entender potenciales efectos
cruzados, reordenar los estantes del supermercado, etc. 

En general, los conjuntos frecuentes indican asociaciones (y cuantificaciones de la asociación) 
entre artículos que hay que tomar en cuenta al momento
de tomar decisiones. Esto normalmente se llama análisis de **market basket**.

El análisis de subconjuntos frecuentes puede ser utilizado para 
otros propósitos, como veremos más adelante.

## Datos de canastas

Consideremos el siguiente ejemplo chico del paquete [arules](https://github.com/mhahsler/arules).
Contiene unas $10$ mil canastas observadas en de un supermercado durante un mes,
agregadas a $169$ categorías. En muchos casos prácticos, el número de canastas o transacciones
puede llegar hasta los miles o millones de millones de transacciones, y
el número de artículos puede ser de miles o decenas de miles.





```r
data(Groceries) # del paquete arules
Groceries
```

```
## transactions in sparse format with
##  9835 transactions (rows) and
##  169 items (columns)
```

```r
lista_mb <- as(Groceries, "list")
```

Estas son tres **canastas** (tickets) de ejemplo:


```r
lista_mb[[2]]
## [1] "tropical fruit" "yogurt"         "coffee"
lista_mb[[52]]
## [1] "canned beer"
lista_mb[[3943]]
## [1] "sausage"        "UHT-milk"       "flour"          "flower (seeds)"
```

Describiremos algunas características típicas de este tipo de datos. En primer
lugar, 
podemos calcular la distribución del 
número de artículos por canasta, y vemos que es una cantidad relativamente baja
en comparación al número total de artículos existentes:


```r
sprintf("Número de canastas: %s", length(lista_mb))
```

```
## [1] "Número de canastas: 9835"
```

```r
num_items <- sapply(lista_mb, length)
sprintf("Promedio de artículos por canasta: %.3f", mean(num_items))
```

```
## [1] "Promedio de artículos por canasta: 4.409"
```

```r
qplot(num_items, binwidth = 1)
```

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="384" />

Podemos hacer una tabla con las canastas y
examinar los artículos más frecuentes:


```r
canastas_tbl <- tibble(
  canasta_id = 1:length(lista_mb),
  articulos = lista_mb) 
canastas_tbl
```

```
## # A tibble: 9,835 × 2
##    canasta_id articulos
##         <int> <list>   
##  1          1 <chr [4]>
##  2          2 <chr [3]>
##  3          3 <chr [1]>
##  4          4 <chr [4]>
##  5          5 <chr [4]>
##  6          6 <chr [5]>
##  7          7 <chr [1]>
##  8          8 <chr [5]>
##  9          9 <chr [1]>
## 10         10 <chr [2]>
## # … with 9,825 more rows
```

```r
canastas_tbl$articulos[[1]]
```

```
## [1] "citrus fruit"        "semi-finished bread" "margarine"          
## [4] "ready soups"
```


```r
num_canastas <- nrow(canastas_tbl)
articulos_frec <- canastas_tbl |>
    unnest(cols = articulos) |>
    group_by(articulos) |>

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png" width="384" />

Y vemos que hay algunos pocos artículos que ocurren a tasas muy altas en 
las canastas. La mayoría tiene tasas de ocurrencia baja, y muchos ocurren en una
fracción pequeña de las transacciones.

Un primer análisis que podríamos considerar es 
el de canastas **completas** que ocurren frecuentemente. ¿Qué tan
útil crees que puede ser este análisis?


```r
colapsar_canasta <- function(x, sep = "-"){
  # convierte cada canasta a una cadena
  x |> as.character() |> sort() |> paste(collapse = "-")
}
canastas_conteo <- canastas_tbl |>
                mutate(canasta_str = map_chr(articulos, colapsar_canasta)) |>
                group_by(canasta_str) |>
                summarise(n = n(), .groups = "drop") |>
                mutate(prop = round(n /num_canastas, 5)) |>
                arrange(desc(n))
nrow(canastas_conteo)
```

```
## [1] 7011
```

Y aquí vemos las canastas más frecuentes:

Hay algunas canastas (principalmente canastas que contienen solo
un artículo) que aparecen con frecuencia considerable (alrededor de $1\%$ o $2\%$), 
pero las canastas están bastante dispersas en el espacio de posibles 
canastas (que es gigantesco: ¿puedes calcularlo?). Debido a esta dispersión 
este análisis es de utilidad limitada.

\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">**Datos de canastas**

1. El tamaño de las canastas normalmente es chico 
  (por ejemplo de $1$ a $30$ artículos distintos).
2. El número total de artículos típicamente no es muy grande (de cientos a cientos de miles, por ejemplo).
3. El número de canastas puede ser mucho mayor (en algunos casos miles de millones) y quizá no pueden leerse completas en memoria.
4. La mayoría de los artículos ocurre con frecuencias relativamente bajas, aunque unos cuantos tienen frecuencia alta.
5.  El número de canastas distintas es alto, y hay pocas canastas frecuentes. </div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}

El último inciso señala que encontrar canastas frecuentes no será muy informativo. En lugar de eso buscamos conjuntos de artículos (que podríamos llamar subcanastas) que forman parte de muchas canastas. 


## Conjuntos frecuentes

Un enfoque simple y escalable para analizar estas canastas es el
de los conjuntos frecuentes (frequent itemsets). 

\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">**Conjuntos frecuentes**

Consideramos un conjunto de artículos
$I = \{s_1,s_2,\ldots, s_k\}$. El **soporte** de $I$ lo definimos
como la proporción de canastas que contienen (al menos) estos artículos:
$$P(I) = \frac{n(I)}{n},$$
donde $n(I)$ es el número de canastas que
contienen todos los artículos de $I$, y $n$ es el número total de canastas.

Sea $s\in (0,1)$. Para este valor fijo $s$, decimos que un conjunto de artículos $I$ es un **conjunto frecuente** cuando $P(I)\geq s$.
</div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}


#### Ejercicio {-}
Considera las canastas {1,2,3}, {1,2}, {2,4}, {2,3}. ¿Cuáles son los itemsets frecuentes de soporte > 0.4?


#### Ejemplo {-}
Explicamos más adelante la función *apriori* de *arules*,
pero por lo pronto podemos examinar algunos 
conjuntos frecuentes de soporte mínimo $0.01$ (como hay alrededor de 
$10000$ canastas, esto significa que canastas que aparecieron al menos $100$
veces durante el mes):


```r
pars <- list(supp = 0.01, target = "frequent itemsets")
ap <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars)
```


```r
length(ap)
```

```
## [1] 333
```

Veamos algunos conjuntos frecuentes de tamaño $1$:


```r
ap_1 <- subset(ap, size(ap) == 1) 
length(ap_1)
## [1] 88
sort(ap_1, by = "support") |> DATAFRAME() |> head(10)

**Observaciones**:

- Si hay $m$ artículos, entonces el número de _posibles_ itemsets es de $2^m -1$. Este es un 
número típicamente muy grande. En nuestro ejemplo, existen unos $7\times 10^{50}$ 
posibles itemsets. El número de itemsets de un tamaño fijo, por ejemplo $k=5$, también puede ser muy
grande ( $169 \choose 5$ es del orden de mil millones).
- Si existe un gran número canastas, contar todas las posibles subcanastas que ocurren es poco factible si lo hacemos por fuerza bruta: requeríamos usar tablas en disco  que son relativamente lentas, y quizá no podremos mantener en memoria todos los conteos.
- Sin embargo, en el ejemplo de arriba encontramos solamente 333 itemsets frecuentes: este número es relativamente chico comparado con el número de posibles itemsets. Esto nos da
indicios que contando de una manera apropiada puede ser posible encontrar **todos** los
itemsets frecuentes de cualquier orden.

#### Ejemplo {-}
Si reducimos el soporte a $0.0001$ (que implica prácticamente que queremos contar todos
los itemsets que ocurren), obtenemos:


```r
pars_2 <- list(supp = 0.0001, target="frequent itemsets", maxtime = 0, maxlen = 6)
ap_todos <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars_2)
```

```
## Apriori

## sorting and recoding items ... [169 item(s)] done [0.00s].
## creating transaction tree ... done [0.00s].
## checking subsets of size 1 2 3 4 5 6
```

```
## Warning in apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars_2): Mining stopped (maxlen
## reached). Only patterns up to a length of 6 returned!
```

```
##  done [1.60s].
## sorting transactions ... done [0.00s].
## writing ... [10945131 set(s)] done [1.60s].
## creating S4 object  ... done [2.44s].
```

Entonces el número de itemsets que obtenemos (longitud menor o igual a $5$) es 



```r
length(ap_todos)
```

```
## [1] 10945131
```

que es órdenes de magnitud más grande que el conjunto de todas las transacciones. 

En este ejemplo chico, el cálculo de esta colección (hasta canastas de tamaño 6) 
puede requierir menos de unos 2Gb de memoria (8Gb pueden 
no son ser suficientes para encontrar 
los de tamaño $8$, $9$ y $10$).
Puedes ver entonces que para conjuntos de transacciones masivos, 
**contar todos los itemsets generalmente será un proceso muy lento si no es que más bien infactible**.


## Monotonicidad de conjuntos frecuentes

Consideramos el problema de encontrar los conjuntos frecuentes.

Como discutimos arriba en las características de los datos de canastas,
suponemos que 

- La lista de transacciones es muy grande, y
no puede leerse completa en memoria,
- Sin embargo, para una sola canasta, es posible calcular de manera
relativamente rápida todos los subconjuntos de tamaño $k$ (para $k=1,2,3,4$, por ejemplo). Por ejemplo, si una canasta tiene $10$ artículos, hay $\binom{10}{3}$ subcanastas
de tamaño 3, $\binom{10}{3} = 210$. Calcular estos subconjuntos es relativamente rápido comparado con leer de disco una transacción.
- Finalmente, suponemos que el número de itemsets frecuentes es relativamente chico, debido a que el número de articulos que son más frecuentes es relativamente bajo
(lo cual también depende de que escojamos un soporte suficientemente alto).

Bajo estas características, el principio básico que hace posible hacer los conteos de itemsets frecuentes es el siguiente:


\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">**Monotonicidad de itemsets**
Sea $s$ un nivel de soporte mínimo fijo.  
  
- Si un itemset $I$ es frecuente, entonces todos sus subconjuntos son
itemsets frecuentes.
- Equivalentemente, si algún subconjunto de un itemset no es frecuente, entonces el itemset no puede ser frecuente. Así que *a priori*, no es necesario examinar o contar itemsets que contienen al menos un subconjunto 
que no sea frecuente.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}

Este hecho, junto con la selección de un soporte mínimo para los itemsets frecuentes,
es el que hace que la búsqueda y conteo de itemsets frecuentes sea un problema
**factible**, pues podemos descartar una gran cantidad de artículos o itemsets *a priori* de manera simple, y no es necesario contar todo.

La demostración es como sigue: Sea $n(I)$  el número de canastas
que contiene $I$, y supongamos que $\tfrac{n(I)}{n}>s$ ($I$ es un conjunto frecuente).
Sea ahora $J\subset I$. Entonces cualquier canasta que contiene los
artículos de $I$ contiene también los artículos de $J$ (que son menos),
de forma que $n(J)\geq n(I)$. Como $\tfrac{n(I)}{n}>s$, entonces $J$ es un conjunto
frecuente.


#### Ejemplo {-}
En nuestro ejemplo anterior, el número total de itemsets de tamaño $2$ es

```r
length(subset(ap_todos, size(ap_todos) == 2))
```

```
## [1] 9636
```
Comparamos con los pares frecuentes cuando el soporte es $1\%$:

```r
length(subset(ap, size(ap) == 2))
```

```
## [1] 213
```
una diferencia de casi dos ordenes de magnitud.

## Algoritmo a-priori

Para entender cómo aplicamos monotonicidad, consideremos cómo calcularíamos los pares frecuentes.

1. Primero calculamos los artículos frecuentes (itemsets de tamaño $1$), que
son los artículos que aparecen en al menos una proporción $s$ de las canastas. 
  - (Contar candidatos) Esto requiere recorrer el archivo de transacciones y contar **todos** los artículos. 
  - (Podar) Examinamos los conteos y seleccionamos aquellos artículos que son frecuentes.

2. Por el principio de monotonicidad, ningún par frecuente puede contener
un artículo no frecuente. Así que para calcular pares:
  - (Contar candidatos) Recorremos el archivo de transacciones. Para cada transacción, solo contamos
  pares candidatos cuyos dos artículos son artículos frecuentes (del paso anterior)
  - (Podar) Examinamos los conteos y seleccionamos aquellos pares que son frecuentes.

Nótese que este algoritmo requiere dos pasadas sobre el conjunto de transacciones.

#### Ejercicio {-}
Aplica este algoritmo para las canastas {1,2,3}, {1,8}, {2,4}, {2,3,6,7,8}, {2,3,8}, {1,7,8},
{1,2,3,5}, {2,3}. (soporte > 0.3)

**Observaciones**

1. En este algoritmo, no es necesario leer todas las transacciones a la vez, podemos procesarlas por bloques, por ejemplo.
2. Usamos una pasada de los datos para cada tamaño de itemset frecuente.
2. En la primera pasada del algoritmo (artículos frecuentes), típicamente no es un problema mantener el conteo de *todos* los artículos en memoria (hay relativamente pocos artículos).
3. Si en la segunda pasada no usáramos monotonicidad, tendríamos que mantener conteos de todos los posibles pares (que son del orden $m^2$, donde $m$ es el número de artículos). Mantener este conteo en memoria podría ser difícil si el número de artículos es grande. Sin embargo, el número de artículos frecuentes generalmente es considerablemente menor.

Para itemsets de tamaño más grande, el algoritmo original a priori  [@Agrawal] es:

\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">**Algoritmos a-priori**
  
Sea $L_1$ el conjunto de itemsets frecuentes de tamaño 1.

Para obtener $L_k$, el conjunto de itemsets frecuentes de tamaño $k$:

1. Sea $C_k$ el conjunto de candidatos de tamaño $k$, construido a partir de $L_{k-1}$ (monotonicidad).
2. Para cada transacción $t$,
    - Calculamos $S_t$, que son los candidatos en $C_k$ que están en $t$.
    - Agregamos 1 a cada conteo de los candidatos en $S_t$.
3. Filtramos los elementos de $C_k$ que tengan conteo mayor que el soporte definido para obtener $L_k$
4. Seguimos hasta que encontramos que algún $L_k$ es vacío (no hay itemsets frecuente), o para alguna $k$ fija.
  </div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}
  
**Observaciones**: Este algoritmo se puede implementar de distintas maneras, por ejemplo:

- Hay distintas maneras de generar el conjunto $C_{k}$ de candidatos. El paper original sugiere (suponiendo que los artículos siempre están ordenados en los itemsets) hacer un join de $L_{k-1}$ consigo misma. Por ejemplo,
para generar los tríos candidatos $C_3$ a partir de $L_2$ hacemos


```sql
SELECT A.item1, A.item2, B.item2
FROM L2 AS A, L2 AS B
WHERE A.item1 = B.item1, A.item2 < B.item2
```

donde los itemsets estén ordenados en las canastas (por índice o
lexicográficamente). 

- Hay también distintas maneras de calcular $C_t$ para cada transacción. El 
paper original sugiere una estructura de árbol para encontrar los
subconjuntos de $t$ que están en $C_k$, y no es neceasrio calcular
$C_k$. Ver también [@borgelt].

- Más detalles de la implementación de los algoritmos (incluyendo
algunos más modernos como FPGrowth, que está implementado en spark) 
se puede encontrar en [@mmd] y en [@borgelt]. FPGrowth construye una representación
eficiente
de árbol para los itemsets frecuentes y con esto evita el paso de construcción
de candidatos (aunque tiene que mantener en memoria el árbol, que puede ser
una estructura grande).

## Modelos simples para análisis de canastas

Podemos entender mejor el comportamiento de este análisis con
algunos modelos simples para datos de canastas.

En primer lugar, pensamos que los datos están en forma
de codificación dummy (aunque no usemos esta representación para los datos
reales, podemos considerarlo teóricamente). Una canasta es entonces un renglón
de ceros y unos, dependendiendo qué artículos están o no en la canasta:

$$X= (X_1,X_2,\ldots, X_m)$$
donde $X_i = 1$ si el artículo $i$ está en la canasta, y $X_i=0$ si no está. 

Podríamos pensar entonces en construir modelos para la conjunta
de las canastas

$$P(X_1=x_1,X_2=x_2,\ldots, X_m=x_m)$$

### Ejemplo {-}
Por ejemplo, si los items son 1-camisa, 2-pantalones, 3-chamarra, podríamos tener las dos transacciones

- $X = (1,0,0)$, para alguien que solo compró una camisa
- $X = (1,0,1)$, para alguien que solo compró camisa y chamarra

Y podemos inventar una conjunta para todas las canastas, por ejemplo


```
## # A tibble: 8 × 4
##       p     c    ch  prob
##   <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
## 1     0     0     0 0    
## 2     0     0     1 0.105
## 3     0     1     0 0.186
## 4     0     1     1 0.186
## 5     1     0     0 0.186
## 6     1     0     1 0.186
## 7     1     1     0 0.105
## 8     1     1     1 0.047
```

A partir de esta conjunta podemos calcular cualquier probabilidad
que nos interese. Por ejemplo, la probabilidad de que alguien compre
una camisa dado que compró un pantalón es:


```r
prob_cp <- filter(probs, p == 1 & c == 1) |> pull(prob) |> sum()
prob_p <- filter(probs, p == 1) |> pull(prob) |> sum()
(prob_cp / prob_p) |> round(2)
```

```
## [1] 0.29
```

---

Como discutimos arriba, intentar estimar esta conjunta usando simples
conteos de canastas no funciona, pues hay $2^n$ posibles canastas,
e incluso cuando $n$ no es tan grande (por ejemplo $200$) es un número muy
grande. Tenemos dos caminos (o una combinación de ellos): podemos hacer 
supuestos acerca de esta conjunta (y checar si son apropiados), 
o concentrarnos en estimar solamente algunas de sus características.

Más adelante veremos algunas técnicas basadas en modelos (por ejemplo
*embeddings* de productos y canastas)
que pueden ser útiles para el problema de encontrar asociaciones entre artículos.
Por el momento, en market basket tomamos el segundo camino: estimar
sólo algunas cantidades de la conjunta de ocurrencia de artículos.

La simplificación de market basket es concentrarnos en **algunas marginales que involucren a pocos artículos** de 
esta distribución, que tienen una forma como
$$P(X_{i}=1,X_{j}=1),$$
que es la probabilidad de que el conjunto ${i,j}$ aparezca en una canasta dada, o en los términos de market basket, el soporte del itemset ${i,j}$.

\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">La búsqueda de itemsets frecuentes se traduce entonces en buscar
marginales de este tipo que no involucren muchas variables
y que tengan valores altos - buscamos *modas* en las marginales de
la distribución de las canastas.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}

### Modelo de artículos independientes {-}

Por otro lado, si hacemos supuestos acerca de la conjunta es posible ajustar modelos
a los datos de canastas. En primer lugar, podemos considerar el modelo 
simplista que establece que la aparición o no de cada artículo es independiente del resto:

$$P(X_1=x_1,\ldots, X_m=x_m) =\prod_m P(X_j=x_j)$$

Y adicionalmente, suponemos que la probabilidad de cada artículo es fija dada
por
$$P(X_j=1)=p_j$$. Este modelo no es realista, pero podemos usarlo para entender
algunos aspectos de nuestros algoritmos de conjuntos frecuentes.


El soporte (bajo el modelo teórico) de 
un conjunto de $k$ artículos es
$$P(X_{s_1}=1,X_{s_2}=1,\ldots, X_{s_k}=1)=p_{s_1}p_{s_2}\cdots p_{s_k}$$

Podemos ver qué pasa si simulamos transacciones bajo este modelo
simple. Primero definimos una función para simular canastas con probabilidades
dadas para los artículos


```r
simular_transacciones <- function(n_items, n_trans, prob){
  etiquetas <- names(prob)
  canastas <- map(seq(1, n_trans), function(i){
      seleccion <- rbinom(n_items, 1, prob = prob)
      etiquetas[seleccion == 1]
  })
  canastas
}
```

Y ahora simulamos usando las proporciones que encontramos en el conjunto *Groceries*


```r
set.seed(1299)
probs_items <- itemFrequency(Groceries) |> sort()
trans <- simular_transacciones(n_items = 169, n_trans = 10000, prob = probs_items)
ap_indep <- apriori(trans, 
                    parameter = list(support = 0.005, target = "frequent itemsets"),
                    control = list(verbose = FALSE))
```

Por ejemplo, aquí vemos algunos pares frecuentes encontrados por el algoritmo:


```r
inspect(subset(ap_indep, support > 0.015 & size(ap_indep)==2))
```

```

Estos pares frecuentes no se deben a asociaciones entre los artículos,
sino a co-ocurrencia en las canastas. Artículos frecuentes apareceran en pares
frecuentes, tríos frecuentes, etc. Comparamos por ejemplo el número de reglas
encontradas para los datos reales, contra 20 simulaciones de este modelo:



```r
# parámetros de apriori
pars <- list(supp = 0.005, target="frequent itemsets")
# producir 10 simulaciones
replicaciones <- map(1:20, function(i){
  trans <- simular_transacciones(n_items = 169, n_trans = 10000, prob = probs_items)
  ap_indep <- apriori(trans, parameter = pars, control = list(verbose = FALSE))
  conteos <- table(size(ap_indep))
  tibble(rep = i, long = names(conteos), n = as.numeric(conteos))
})
reps_tbl <- bind_rows(replicaciones)
```

Ahora vamos a comparar con el análisis de las canastas reales:


```r
# calcular observados
ap <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars, control = list(verbose = FALSE))
conteos_obs <- table(size(ap))
obs_tbl <- tibble(long = names(conteos_obs), n = as.numeric(conteos_obs))
ggplot(reps_tbl, aes(x = long, y = n)) + geom_jitter(height = 0) +
  geom_point(data = obs_tbl, colour = "red", size = 2) + 
  labs(x = "Tamaño")
```

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png" width="672" />

Y vemos claramente que el modelo simple está lejos de ajustar los datos que observamos en
las canastas de *Groceries*. Hay muchas más combinaciones frecuentes de tamaño
$2$ y $3$ de lo que esperaríamos si los artículos se compraran independientemente, y
esto indica asociaciones positivas entre artículos que nos gustaría descubrir.
Veremos más adelante cómo identificar este tipo de conjuntos frecuentes.

Finalmente, comparamos los itemsets de ambos casos:


```r
coinciden <- match(ap, ap_indep)
## Warning in match(x@items, table@items, nomatch = nomatch, incomparables =
## incomparables): Item coding not compatible, recoding item matrices first.
coinciden[500:505]
## [1] 323 324 325  NA  NA  NA
inspect(ap[500])
##     items              support    count
## [1] {pork, rolls/buns} 0.01128622 111
inspect(ap_indep[323])
##     items              support count
## [1] {pork, rolls/buns} 0.011   110
```


```r
sum(!is.na(coinciden)) # contar los matches 
## [1] 491
length(ap)
## [1] 1001
length(ap_indep)
## [1] 521
```

Y vemos que en el análisis de datos reales estamos capturando la mayor parte
de los itemsets frecuentes del modelo independiente. Estos itemsets se explican
por la frecuencia simple de aparición de cada artículo.

## Soporte teórico y conjuntos frecuentes

El tamaño de los datos de transacciones está relacionado con los mínimos
soportes que tiene sentido analizar. Supongamos por ejemplo que
tenemos un conjunto de $n$ transacciones, y buscamos soporte mínimo de $s$. Consideramos
entonces que un conjunto $I$ tiene soporte $s_I$ teórico (el que observaríamos con una muestra muy grande), y nuestro interés es ver qué tan bien podemos
identificar como frecuentes aquellos conjuntos que satisfagan $s_I > s$.

Notamos primero que el valor esperado de ocurrencias $n(I)$ de un conjunto $I$ en los
tiene una distribución binomial con número de pruebas
$n$ y probabilidad de observar un éxito de $s_I$. 
Si suponemos que $ns_I \leq 1$ y $n$ no es muy chico, entonces
la probabilidad de observar $I$ 0 veces es aproximadamente


```r
tab_1 <- tibble(ns = seq(0.1, 1, 0.2)) |> 
  mutate(prob_no_obs = ppois(0, ns))
tab_1
```

```
## # A tibble: 5 × 2
##      ns prob_no_obs
##   <dbl>       <dbl>
## 1   0.1       0.905
## 2   0.3       0.741
## 3   0.5       0.607
## 4   0.7       0.497
## 5   0.9       0.407
```
De forma que con valores de $n$ y $s$ tales que $ns <1$ , típicamente no observaremos una buena parte de todos los conjuntos frecuentes que buscamos encontrar.

Supongamos entonces que $ns\geq 5$, y queremos aproximar la probabilidad de
encontrar una canasta $I$ tal que $s_I = (1+\alpha) s$ (es decir, canastas con soporte
de al menos $\alpha$% más que el soporte mínimo elegido). Entonces usando
la aproximación normal a la binomial, la probabilidad de capturar a $I$ correctamente
como frecuente es aproximadamente

$$P \left (Z > \frac{\sqrt{n}(s - s_I)}{\sqrt{s_I(1-s_I)}} \right ) = 
P \left (Z > \frac{\sqrt{n}(s - (1+\alpha)s)}{\sqrt{s_I(1-s_I)}} \right )\approx
P \left (Z > -\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{1+\alpha}}\sqrt{ns}\right )$$

```r
crossing(ns = seq(5, 100, 5), alpha = c(0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25)) |>
  mutate(prob_capturar = map2_dbl(ns, alpha, 
    \(ns, alpha) pnorm(sqrt(ns) * alpha/sqrt(1-alpha)))) |> 
ggplot(aes(x = ns, y = prob_capturar, colour = factor(alpha))) +
  geom_line() + geom_point() + ylab("Recall/Sensibilidad")
```

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png" width="672" />

Como ejercicio, puedes calcular la probabilidad de capturar incorrectamente
como frecuente un conjunto $I$ con $s_I = s/(1+\alpha)$ (la tasa de falsos
positivos). En general, vemos que tomar $ns$ menor que 10 no necesariamente es buena 
idea

Así que si queremos capturar con probabilidad al menos 90% las canastas
cuyo soporte es 20% mayor al soporte mínimo, necesitamos tomar $s$ tal que
$ns>30$, por ejemplo.

- Usualmente queremos hacer el soporte mínimo $s$ un poco más chico, para que
capturemos con alta probabilidad aquellos conjuntos de soporte teórico $s$ (aunque
esto implica también que capturaremos más conjuntos de menor soporte que el teórico).
- La elección de punto de corte es más o menos arbitraria (lo cual es una dificultad
del análisis de conjuntos frecuentes), pero es importante recordar que si hacemos
$s$ mucho más chico que estas recomendaciones, capturaremos por azar muchos
conjuntos cuya frecuencia teórica es mucho más baja de lo que esperábamos.
- Finalmente, recordamos que cuanto más chico tomemos el soporte, más conjuntos
frecuentes encontraremos, y el procesamiento puede tomar mucho tiempo.

### Ejemplo {-}

Podemos experimentar con el modelo de independencia:


```r
simular_num_reglas <- function(n_trans, prob, pars){
  n_items <- length(prob)
  etiquetas <- 1:n_items
  if(!is.null(names(prob))) {
    etiquetas <- names(prob)
  }
  trans <- map(1:n_trans, function(i){
      etiquetas[which(rbinom(n_items, 1, prob = prob) == 1)]
  })
  ap_indep <- apriori(trans, parameter = pars, control = list(verbose = FALSE))
  conteos <- table(size(ap_indep))
  tibble(long = names(conteos), n = as.numeric(conteos))
}
# fijamos para el ejemplo
probs_items <- sort(itemFrequency(Groceries))
pars_1 <- list(support = 0.005, target = "frequent itemsets")
simular_1 <- function(n_trans){
  sim_tbl <- simular_num_reglas(n_trans = n_trans, prob = probs_items, pars = pars_1)  
  sim_tbl
}
```


```r
set.seed(125)
n_trans <- c(10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, 12800, 25600, 51200)
reps <- tibble(n_trans = rep(n_trans, each = 5)) |> 
  mutate(conteos = map(n_trans, simular_1)) |> 
  mutate(ns = n_trans * 0.005)
reps_long_2 <- reps |> unnest(cols = conteos) |> 
  filter(long == 2)
```


```r
ggplot(reps_long_2, aes(x=factor(ns), y = n)) + geom_boxplot() +
  ylab("Número de conjuntos frecuentes detectados (k=2)") +
  xlab("Soporte crudo (ns)") + labs(subtitle = "Soporte min 0.005") 
```

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-36-1.png" width="672" />

**Observaciones**

- Para conjuntos de transacciones chicos no podemos capturar muchos conjuntos
frecuentes teóricos porque no observamos suficientes transacciones. 

- Para niveles medios de número de transacciones, podemos obtener resultados ruidosos: muchos
subconjuntos que identificamos como frecuentes no lo son realmente (es variación muestral).

- Cuanto tenemos un número suficientemente alto de transacciones, el número de subconjuntos frecuentes
encontrados se estabiliza en el valor teórico verdadero del número de conjuntos frecuentes
que existen.

## Reglas de asociación

Aunque algunas veces lo único que nos interesa es la co-ocurrencia de artículos (por ejemplo,
para entender qué artículos se podrían ver potencialmente afectados por acciones en otros artículos que están en el mismo itemset frecuente), otras veces nos interesa entender qué artículos
están asociados a lo largo de canastas por otros factores, como tipo de cliente, tipo de
ocasión o propósito (por ejemplo, hora del día, hacer un pastel, promociones,
decisiones de organización de estantes), etc.

Con este propósito podemos organizar la información de los itemsets frecuentes
en términos de reglas de asociación. 
Un ejemplo de una regla de asociación es:

*Entre las personas que compran leche y pan, un $40\%$ compra también yogurt*

\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">Una **regla de asociación** es una relación de la forma $I\to j$, donde
$I$ es un conjunto de artículos (el antecedente) y $j$ es un artículo (el consecuente).
Definimos la **confianza** de esta regla como
$$\hat{P}(I\to j) = \hat{P}(j|I) = \frac{n(I\cup {j})}{n(I)} = \hat{P}(I\cup j)/\hat{P}(I), $$
  es decir, la proporción de canastas que incluyen al itemset $I\cup {j}$  entre
las canastas que incluyen al itemset $I$. La confianza siempre está entre 0 y 1.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}

**Observaciones**:

- Por monotonicidad, si  $J$ es un conjunto de artículos más grande que $I$ (es decir $I\subset J$), entonces $n(J) \leq n(I)$: cualquier canasta que 
contiene a $J$ también contiene a $I$, y puede haber algunas canastas que contienen a $I$ no contienen a $J$.

- Bajo el modelo de items independientes, todas las confianzas satisfacen $P(I\to j)=P(j)$ (la confianza simplemente es la probabilidad de observar el artículo $j$, independientemente del
antecedente).

- **Confianza alta** no necesariamente significa una asociación de los items: si el consecuente $j$ tiene soporte alto, entonces podemos obtener confianza alta aunque no haya asociación.

### Ejemplo {-}

En nuestro ejemplo anterior, el soporte de  {whole milk,yogurt} es 
de $0.0560$, el soporte de {whole milk} es $0.2555$, así que la confianza
de la regla $whole milk \to yogurt$ es $\frac{0.0560}{0.2555}=$ 0.22

---


Podemos usar la confianza para filtrar reglas que tienen alta probabilidad de cumplirse:

### Ejemplo {-}



```r
pars <- list(supp = 0.01, confidence = 0.20, target="rules", 
             ext = TRUE, minlen = 2)
reglas <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars)
```
Podemos examinar algunas de las reglas:

```r
inspect(reglas[1:10,])
```

```

```

En la siguiente tabla, *coverage* es el soporte del antecedente (lhs = left hand side). Agregamos también el error estándar de la estimación de confidence (que es una proporción basada en el número de veces que se observa el antecedente):


```r
df_1 <- sort(reglas, by = "confidence") |> DATAFRAME()
df_2 <- df_1 |> select(LHS, RHS, coverage, confidence, support) |>
  head(100) |>
  mutate(lhs.base = num_canastas * coverage) |>
  mutate(conf.ee = sqrt(confidence * (1 - confidence) / lhs.base)) |>
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(.x, 2)) 
DT::datatable(df_2 |> select(-lhs.base))
```

**Observaciones**:

- Nota que estas tres cantidades están ligadas en cada canasta por 
$coverage\times confidence = support$. Usa un argumento de probabilidad condicional 
para mostrarlo.

- Muchas de las reglas con confianza alta tienen como consecuente un artículo de soporte
alto (por ejemplo, *whole milk*), como explicamos arriba. Nótese también que las reglas
con confianza más alta tienden a tener soporte bajo. Esto lo discutiremos más adelante.

#### Ejercicio {-} 
- Para un mismo consecuente (por ejemplo whole milk), examina cómo varían
los valores de *confidence*. ¿A qué crees que se deba esto?

---

Es natural que artículos frecuentes ocurran en muchas canastas juntas, es decir,
que reglas formadas con ellas tengan confianza relativamente alta. Por ejemplo,
la regla *pan -> verduras* podría tener confianza y soporte alto, pero esto no
indica ninguna asociación especial entre estos artículos. La razón puede ser que
*verduras* es un artículo muy común.

Podemos refinar las reglas de asociación considerando 
qué tan diferente es $P(j|I)$ de $P(j)$. La primera cantidad es la probabilidad
de observar el item $j$ bajo la información de que la canasta contiene a $I$. Si esta
cantidad no es muy diferente a $P(j)$, entonces consideramos que esta regla
no tiene mucho *interés*. 

\BeginKnitrBlock{resumen}<div class="resumen">El **lift** o **intéres** de una regla $I\to j$ se define como
$$L(I\to j) = \frac{\hat{P}({j}|I)}{\hat{P}({j})},$$
  es decir, la confianza de la regla $I\to j$ dividida entre la proporción
de canastas que contienen $j$.</div>\EndKnitrBlock{resumen}

En nuestro ejemplo, veamos dos reglas con interés muy distinto:

```r
df_1 <- arrange(df_1, desc(lift))
df_1[c(4, nrow(df_1)),] |> select(LHS, RHS, coverage, confidence, lift)
```

```
##        LHS               RHS   coverage confidence      lift
## 4   {beef} {root vegetables} 0.05246568  0.3313953 3.0403668
## 231 {soda}      {whole milk} 0.17437722  0.2297376 0.8991124
```
La primera regla tiene un interés mucho más alto que la segunda, lo que indica una asociación
más importante entre los dos artículos. 

**Observaciones**

- Cuando decimos que un grupo de artículos están asociados, generalmente
estamos indicando que forma alguna regla de asociación con **lift** alto.

- En principio también podría haber reglas con *lift* muy por debajo de uno,
y eso también indica una asociación (por ejemplo coca y pepsi). Pero el método
de itemsets frecuentes no es muy apropiado para buscar estas reglas, pues precisamente esas reglas tienden a tener soporte y confianza bajas.

- El valor del lift también puede escribirse (deméstralo) como
$$ \frac{\hat{P}(I\cup\{j\})}{\hat{P}(I)\hat{P}({j})},$$
Cuando los artículos son independientes, esta cantidad está cercana a $1$. Es una medida de qué tan lejos de independencia están
la ocurrencia de los itemsets $I$ y $j$. 



#### Ejemplo {-}

```r
df_1 <- sort(reglas, by = "lift") |> DATAFRAME()
```

En esta tabla, *coverage* es el soporte del antecedente (lhs = left hand side):


```r
df_2 <- df_1 |> select(LHS, RHS, coverage, lift, confidence, support) |>
  head(100) |>
  mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(.x, 2)) 
DT::datatable(df_2)
```

--- 

Las reglas de asociación se calculan comenzando por calcular los
itemsets frecuentes según el algoritmo a priori 
explicado arriba. Para encontrar las reglas de asociación hacemos:

- Para cada itemset frecuente $f$, tomamos como candidatos a consecuentes
los artículos $i$ de $f$
- Si la confianza $\frac{\hat{P}(I)}{\hat{P}(I-\{j\})}$ es mayor que la confianza mínima,
agregamos la regla de asociación $I\to j$.

Con este proceso encontramos todas las reglas $I\to j$ tales que
$I\cup\{j\}$ es un itemset frecuente.

## Dificultades en el análisis de canastas

El análisis de canastas es un método rápido y simple que nos da varias maneras
de explorar las relaciones entre los artículos. Sin embargo, hay varias dificultades en su 
aplicación.

#### Número de reglas y itemsets {-}

Muchas veces encontramos un número muy grande de itemsets o reglas. Hay varias maneras
de filtrar estas reglas según el propósito. Si filtramos mucho, perdemos reglas que pueden
ser interesantes. Si filtramos poco, es difícil entender globalmente los resultados del análisis.

Un punto de vista es producir una cantidad
de reglas para procesar posteriormente con *queries*: por ejemplo, si nos interesa entender las relaciones de **berries** con otros artículos, podemos filtrar las reglas encontradas y examinarlas más
fácilmente. 

#### Cortes estrictos en el filtrado {-}

Cuando seleccionamos valores mínimos de soporte, confianza y/o lift, estas decisiones
son más o menos arbitrarias. Distintos analistas pueden llegar a resultados distintos,
incluso cuando el propósito del análisis sea similar, y en ocasiones hay que iterar el análisis
para encontrar valores adecuados que den *conjuntos razonables con resultados interesantes*. 
Este último concepto es subjetivo.

#### Redundancia de reglas {-}

Existe alguna redundancia en las reglas que encontramos. Por ejemplo,
podríamos tener {yogurt, berries} -> {whipped cream}, pero también
{yogurt} -> {whipped cream}. Este traslape de reglas hace también difícil
entender conjuntos grandes de reglas.

#### Variabilidad de medidas de calidad {-}

Un problema del análisis clásico de soporte-confianza-lift es la variabilidad
de las estimaciones de confianza y lift.

- Cuando comenzamos poniendo valores de soporte y confianza relativamente bajos, encontramos muchas reglas. Muchas de estas reglas son ruidosas (en un número más
grande de transacciones las descalificaríamos).
- Intentamos muchas veces filtrar u ordenar por *lift*, para considerar las reglas más interesantes
- Sin embargo, encontramos entonces que muchas reglas de lift y/o confianza altas son aquellas que tienen soporte bajo y consecuentes poco frecuentes.  Como veremos más adelante, esto se debe muchas veces
a error de estimación. Los valores más grandes de lift generalmente son sobreestimaciones, por la naturaleza del análisis basado en cortes.
- Si regresamos a incrementar soporte y confianza, potencialmente perdemos reglas interesantes.


Veamos cómo se comportan confianza y lift para el modelo donde no hay asociaciones. 
Utilizamos el **modelo de independencia** que explicamos arriba. 

Obsérvese
que en este modelo *todas las confianzas teóricas son iguales a la frecuencia del consecuente, y
todos los valores teóricos de lift son $1$*:



```r
pars <- list(support=0.002, confidence = 0.0, target="rules", 
             ext = TRUE, minlen = 2)
sims_reglas <- map(1:10, function(i){
  trans <- simular_transacciones(n_items = 169, n_trans = 10000, prob = probs_items)
  ap_random <- apriori(trans, 
      parameter = pars,
      control = list(verbose = FALSE))
  ap_random
})
```

Y notamos que conforme el soporte de la regla es más bajo, hay más variabilidad 
en las estimaciones del confianza y lift. En este caso utilizamos

```

El valor de *confianza* y de *lift* puede ser altamente variable para reglas con soporte
bajo. Podemos tomar dos caminos:

- Cuando hagamos el soporte más bajo, incrementamos el valor de lift mínimo. Esto evita que obtengamos demasiadas reglas que no representan interacciones reales entre los artículos.
- Podemos usar otras medidas que tomen en cuenta la variabilidad de las estimaciones. Por ejemplo, hyper-lift y hyper-confidence están basados en modelos simples (como el que vimos arriba), que filtran aquellos valores de calidad que están en las colas de las distribuciones
de los modelos simples.

## Otras medidas de calidad de reglas

Hay una gran cantidad de medidas de interés de reglas que se han
propuesto desde que se usa el análisis de canasta. Aquí discutimos hyper-lift y hyper-confidence,
que toman en cuenta el soporte de las reglas para proponer puntos de corte [@hyper]. 

Explicamos aquí el hyper-lift para una regla $i\to j$.

Consideramos el modelo de independencia (lo pensamos como
el modelo nulo),
fijando las probabilidades de ocurrencia de los artículos
según los datos (como hicimos en los ejemplos de arriba) y el número
de transacciones. Bajo este
modelo, el número de ocurrencias $X_{\{i,j\}}$ de el itemset
$\{i,j\}$ es una variable aleatoria
con distribución conocida (binomial). Esta distribución representa
la variación que podemos observar en los conteos de $\{i,j\}$
bajo distintas muestras de transacciones del mismo tamaño.

La idea básica del hyperlift es comparar el conteo $n(\{i,j\})$
con la cola superior de la distribución de $X_{i,j}$ bajo el supuesto
de independencia, poniendo

$$HL(I\to j) = \frac{n(\{I,j\})}{Q_\delta (X_{I,j})},$$

donde $Q_\delta$ es tal que $P(X_{I,j} < Q_\delta (X_{I,j}))\approx \delta$.
Tomamos por ejemplo $\delta=0.99$. De esta forma, $HL>1$ sólo cuando
el conteo observado $n(\{i,j\})$ está en la cola superior del conteo
bajo la hipótesis nula de independencia. Esto toma en cuenta la variabilidad de los
conteos (que es grande en términos relativos cuando el soporte es bajo).

**Observaciones**:

- El modelo de independencia que se usa en el
paquete *arules* es una variación del que vimos aquí, 
ver los detalles en [@hyper]. 
- Los valores de *hyper-lift* no son realmente comparables a los de
*lift*, son dos medidas de calidad de asociación diferentes, pero similares
en cuanto a lo que quieren capturar.

### Hyper-lift bajo hipótesis de independencia {-}

Veamos cómo se comporta el *hyper-lift* simulando datos con el modelo de independencia:


```r
trans <- simular_transacciones(n_items = 169, n_trans = 10000, prob = probs_items)
ap_random <- apriori(trans, parameter = 
                       list(support=0.001, confidence = 0.10, 
                            target="rules", ext = TRUE, minlen = 2),
                       control = list(verbose = FALSE))
agregar_hyperlift <- function(reglas, trans){
  quality(reglas) <- cbind(quality(reglas), 
	hyper_lift = interestMeasure(reglas, measure = "hyperLift", 
	transactions = trans))
  reglas
}
ap_random <- agregar_hyperlift(ap_random, trans)
```

 Vemos claramente
que la gran mayoría de reglas obtenidas ahora tienen hyper-lift menor
que uno


```r
plot(ap_random, measure=c("lift","hyper_lift"), shading = "support")
```

```
## To reduce overplotting, jitter is added! Use jitter = 0 to prevent jitter.
```

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-49-1.png" width="672" />

Cortando en un valor relativamente bajo de *hyper-lift*, vemos que nos deshacemos
correctamente de casi todas las reglas:


```r
length(ap_random)
## [1] 3591
length(subset(ap_random, lift > 1))
## [1] 2643
length(subset(ap_random, hyper_lift > 1))
## [1] 130
```


### Hyper-lift para datos de canastas {-}


Ahora aplicamos a los datos reales



```r
pars <- list(supp = 0.002, confidence = 0.10, target="rules", 
             ext = TRUE, minlen = 2)
reglas <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars,
                  control = list(verbose=FALSE))
reglas <- agregar_hyperlift(reglas, Groceries)
length(reglas)
## [1] 8332
```

Vemos que podemos cortar niveles de *hyper-lift* donde obtenemos reglas
de soporte relativamente alto. 


```r
plot(reglas, measure=c("lift","hyper_lift"), shading = "support")
```

```
## To reduce overplotting, jitter is added! Use jitter = 0 to prevent jitter.
```

Si cortamos en valores que dan un número similar de reglas, por ejemplo:


```r
filtradas_hl <- subset(reglas, hyper_lift > 2)
filtradas_lift <- subset(reglas, lift > 3.7)
length(filtradas_hl)
```

```
## [1] 439
```

```r
length(filtradas_lift)
```

```
## [1] 480
```

Vemos que las reglas cortadas con *hyper-lift* tienen mejores valores 
de soporte:


```r
library(patchwork)
soportes <- qqplot(
    quality(filtradas_hl)$support, 
    quality(filtradas_lift)$support, plot.it = FALSE) |> 
  as_tibble()
g_soporte <- ggplot(soportes, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_abline(colour = "red") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Soporte  (filtro Hyperlift)") +
  ylab("Soporte (filtro Lift)") + 
  coord_fixed(xlim = c(0, 0.03), ylim = c(0, 0.03)) +
  ggtitle("Soporte")
soportes <- qqplot(
    quality(filtradas_hl)$lift, 
    quality(filtradas_lift)$lift, plot.it = FALSE) |> 
  as_tibble()
g_lift <- ggplot(soportes, aes(x, y)) +
  geom_abline(colour = "red") +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  xlab("Lift (filtro Hyperlift)") +
  ylab("Lift (filtro Lift)") + coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("Lift")
```


```r
g_soporte + g_lift +
  plot_annotation(
  subtitle = "Soporte y Lift con filtro de reglas por lift vs. hyperlift")
```

<img src="01-market-basket_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png" width="768" />

La distribución de valores de *lift* no es tan diferente, de forma que esta
medida de calidad no se degrada en el conjunto de reglas que encontramos:

En resumen, al utilizar *hyper-lift* para filtrar reglas en lugar de *lift* obtenemos reglas de mejor calidad:

- Descartamos más reglas de soporte bajo que tienen lift alto por azar.
- Los valores de soporte de las reglas tienden a ser más altos.
- Los valores de *lift* son comparables



## Selección de reglas

Ahora discutiremos cómo seleccionar itemsets frecuentes y reglas.

Filtrar con todos estos criterios (soporte, confianza, soporte del antecedente, lift)
no es simple, y depende de los objetivos del análisis. 
Recordemos también que estos análisis están basados justamente en cortes “duros” de los datos, más o menos arbitrarios, y por lo tanto pueden los resultados son variables.

Hay varias maneras de conducir el análisis. Dos tipos útiles son:

- *Itemsets de alta frecuencia*: en este enfoque buscamos reglas con soporte y confianza relativamente altos. Generalmente están asociados a productos muy frecuentes, y
nos indica potencial de interacción entre los artículos. Este análisis es
más una reexpresión de la información contenida en los itemsets frecuentes.
En este caso, podemos filtrar con soporte alto, para evitar estimaciones ruidosas (por ejemplo, soporte  mínimo de 300 canastas).


- *Interacciones altas*: en este enfoque donde buscamos entender nichos. Consideramos valores de soporte y confianza más bajos, pero con valores de *lift/hyper-lift* alto. Este análisis es más útil para entender, por ejemplo, propósitos de compras, convivencia de artículos, tipos de comprador, etc.

- *Colección de reglas para hacer querys*:  la colección de reglas puede ser
más grande, e incluir por ejemplo resultados de distintas corridas de
market basket (incluyendo los dos enfoques de arriba). Las reglas se
examinan seleccionando antecedentes o consecuentes, valores altos de
soporte, etc, según la pregunta particular que se quiera explorar.


### Ejemplo: canastas grandes {-}

Para entender las canastas grandes, podemos variar valores de soporte
y confianza para encontrar un número manejable de reglas.


```r
pars <- list(support = 0.02,
             confidence = 0.20,
             minlen = 2,
             target="rules", ext = TRUE)
reglas_1 <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars)
```

Esta elección de parámetros resulta en 72. 
Podemos ordenar por *hyper-lift*:


```r
plot(reglas_1, colors=c("red", "gray"), engine = "plotly")
```

**Observaciones**: conforme bajamos en esta tabla (ordenada por soporte), las estimaciones
de confianza y *lift* son menos precisas.

## Búsqueda de reglas especializadas

Otra manera de usar este análisis es intenando buscar asociaciones más fuertes (*lift* o *hyper-lift* más alto),
aún cuando sacrificamos soporte. Por su naturaleza, este tipo de análisis puede resultar
en reglas más ruidosas (malas estimaciones de confianza y *lift*), pero es posible filtrar valores
más altos de estas cantidades para encontrar reglas útiles.

Comenzamos con un soporte y confianza más bajas


```r
pars <- list(support = 0.001,
             confidence = 0.1,
             minlen = 2,
             target="rules", ext = TRUE)
b_reglas <- apriori(lista_mb, parameter = pars)
b_reglas <- agregar_hyperlift(b_reglas, lista_mb)
```

Y ahora filtramos con valores más grandes de *hyper-lift*. Podemos
filtrar adicionalmente con coverage para obtener reglas que
aplican con más frecuencia:


```r
b_reglas
```

```
## set of 32783 rules
```

```r
b_reglas_lift <- subset(b_reglas, 
                        hyper_lift > 2.5 & size(b_reglas) < 4 &
                        coverage > 0.01)
b_reglas_lift <- sort(b_reglas_lift, by = "hyper_lift")
DT::datatable(DATAFRAME(b_reglas_lift)  |>
                select(-count, -coverage) |> 
                mutate_if(is.numeric, ~ round(.x, 3)))
```

## Visualización de asociaciones

Tener una visión amplia del market basket analysis es difícil (típicamente, funciona mejor como un resultado al que se le hacen querys, o uno donde filtramos cuidadosamente algunas reglas 
que puedan ser útiles). Así que muchas veces ayuda visualizar los pares con asociación alta:

- Construimos todas las reglas con un antecedente y un consecuente.
- Filtramos las reglas con *hyper-lift* relativamente alto (por ejemplo > $1.5$, pero hay que experimentar).
- Representamos como una gráfica donde los nodos son artículos, y las aristas son relaciones de *lift* alto.
- Usamos algún algoritmo para representar gráficas basado en fuerza, usando como peso el *lift*.



### Ejemplo {#ejemplo-canastas}

En nuestro caso, podríamos tomar (ajustando parámetros para
no obtener demasiadas reglas o demasiado pocas)


```r
b_reglas_lift <- subset(b_reglas, 
                        hyper_lift > 1.75 & confidence > 0.05)
reglas_f <- subset(b_reglas_lift, size(b_reglas_lift) == 2)
```




```r
library(tidygraph)
library(ggraph)
df_reglas <- reglas_f |> DATAFRAME() |> rename(from = LHS, to = RHS) 
df_reglas$weight <- log(df_reglas$hyper_lift)
nrow(df_reglas)
```

```
## [1] 94
```

```r
graph_1 <- as_tbl_graph(df_reglas) |>
  mutate(centrality = centrality_degree(mode = "all")) 

ggraph(graph_1, layout = "fr", start.temp=100) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha=lift), 
                 colour = "red",
                 arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm"))) + 
  geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality, colour = centrality)) + 
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size=4,
                 colour = "gray20", repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph(base_family = "sans")
```

Para gráficas más grandes, es mejor usar software especializado
para investigar las redes que obtenemos (como [Gephi](https://gephi.org)):

```r
b_reglas_lift <- subset(b_reglas, hyper_lift > 1.5 & coverage > 0.01)
reglas_f <- subset(b_reglas_lift, size(b_reglas_lift) == 2)
length(reglas_f)
```

```
## [1] 251
```

```r
reglas_f |> DATAFRAME() |> 
  rename(source = LHS, target = RHS) |> 
  select(-count) |>  
  write_csv(file = "./salidas/reglas.csv")
```


Para el análisis de canastas grandes: 



```r
reglas_f2 <- subset(reglas_1, hyper_lift > 1.3, confidence > 0.4)
df_reglas <- reglas_f2 |> DATAFRAME() |> rename(from = LHS, to = RHS) 
df_reglas$weight <- log(df_reglas$hyper_lift)
graph_1 <- as_tbl_graph(df_reglas) |>
  mutate(centrality = centrality_degree(mode = "all"))

ggraph(graph_1, layout = "fr", start.temp=100) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(alpha=hyper_lift), colour = "red", arrow = arrow(length = unit(4, "mm"))) + 
      geom_node_point(aes(size = centrality, colour = centrality)) + 
      geom_node_text(aes(label = name), size=4,
                   colour = "gray20", repel=TRUE) +
  theme_graph(base_family = "sans")
```

## Otras aplicaciones

- Análisis de tablas de variables categóricas: podemos considerar una tabla con varias variables categóricas. Una canasta son los valores que toman las variables. Por ejemplo, podríamos encontrar reglas como {hogar = propio, ocupación=profesional} -> ingreso = alto. Puedes ver más de este análisis
en [@esl], por ejemplo, sección 14.2.

- Conceptos relacionados: si los artículos son palabras y las canastas documentos (tweets, por ejemplo), este tipo de análisis (una vez que eliminamos las palabras más
frecuentes, que no tienen significado como artículos, preposiciones, etc.), 
puede mostrar palabras que co-ocurren para formar conceptos relacionados.

- Plagiarismo: si los artículos son documentos y los canastas oraciones, el análisis de canastas puede encontrar documentos que contienen las mismas oraciones. Si varias canastas (oraciones) "contienen" los mismos 
artículos (documentos), entonces esas oraciones son indicadores de plagio




## Ejercicios

1. Considera los datos de *datos/recetas*. Lee los datos, asegúrate
que puedes filtrar por tipo de cocina, y que puedes aplicarles
la función *apriori* de *arules* (o cualquier otra herramienta que 
estés utilizando). Calcula la frecuencia de todos los artículos (ingredientes). **El resto de este ejercicio lo haremos a principio
de la siguiente clase**. Acerca de los datos: Cada receta es una canasta, y los
artículos son los ingredientes que usan. Puedes consultar el artículo
original [aquí](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep00196.pdf).

2. Haz algunos experimentos el ejemplo \@ref(ejemplo-canastas) que vimos
en clase: incrementa/decrementa hyperlift, incrementa/decrementa 
soporte. ¿Qué pasa con las gráficas resultantes y el número de reglas?

3. (Opcional) Muchas veces el análisis de canastas puede hacerse
con una muestra de transacciones. Leer secciones 6.4.1 a 6.4.4 de [@mmd].
